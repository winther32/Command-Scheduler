# AFK macro scheduler
by Mac Lyle

## Overview
Through a simple CLI, deteremines which macros to run and for how many minutes. Starts 2 threads, the scheduled macros and a simple progress bar. 
Currently set up to run commands for the discord bot pancake bot, this can easily be adaped for other macros. 

## Adapting for more macros
If a large number of macros are needed to be scheduled, the scheduler function can be adaped to take a dicionary of fucntion names and bools.
